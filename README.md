***CLOUDNEST: Personalized Secure Cloud Storage with Private Server Setup***

****Small Description****
This project creates a secure, self-hosted cloud storage solution enabling users to store, manage, and access files through a web interface. It offers an alternative to third-party cloud services, focusing on user data control and security.

About
CLOUDNEST provides users a secure platform to manage their data without relying on external cloud providers. The system employs AES-256 encryption for individual files and HTTPS for secure data transmission. Developed using the MERN stack, it runs on a local Linux-based server, ensuring data privacy, and is optimized for high control and user customization. Authentication mechanisms like JWT are integrated for controlled access, addressing key concerns around data sovereignty and privacy.

Features

AES-256 file encryption for enhanced security.
Customizable local server environment.
MERN stack-based web interface for seamless file management.
JWT-based user authentication.
SSL/TLS encryption for secure data transfer.
Requirements

Operating System: Linux-based OS for local server.
Development Environment: Node.js and Express.js for backend, MongoDB for data storage.
Encryption: AES-256 for file-level encryption, SSL/TLS for secure data transmission.
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user access.
Server Software: Nginx or Apache for server management.
IDE: Visual Studio Code for development and debugging.
